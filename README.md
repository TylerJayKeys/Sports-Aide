# Sports-Aide

This is my first ever C# project for school.

I've learnt a lot about making clean code since this project, so forgive some of the bad practices used in this repo.
This repo is just to show that I've done *something* in the language. I've done other random snippets of Unity and ASP.NET before, and plan to go back to ASP.NET development soon :)
